## About Me

With 4 years of experience as a Developer and Production Support Engineer, I have built and supported reliable systems while solving complex technical issues. I'm now **transitioning** into cybersecurity, training in **SOC operations**, **SIEM tools** and **threat detection**, with a strong focus on applying my skills to defend against cyber threats.
